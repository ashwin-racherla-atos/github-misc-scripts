# github-misc-scripts

Miscellaneous GitHub scripts, `gh` commands, API calls, GraphQL queries, etc. for power user automation.

See the folder categories:

- [api](/api/README.md)
- [gh-cli](/gh-cli/README.md) 🚀 ✨ ⬅️ *most updated!*
- [git](/git/README.md)
- [graphql](/graphql/README.md)
- [scripts](/scripts/README.md)

> [!TIP]
> The **[gh-cli](/gh-cli/README.md)** folder is the most maintained; I've started adding both API and GraphQL queries in there using `gh api` commands.
